    This page describes evaluation of existing client/server solutions for the MQTT protocol.
    <div class="anchor" id="brokers">
      <h1>Brokers</h1>
      Brokers come as binary packages that, if run from code, should
      be probably just put on their own process and left alone. It is
      generally not expected for the Broker to need to be modified
      to application specific needs, as they get addressed on the Client side.

          Czech commercial broker, promises to send demo over email, looks like a 
          poor mans HiveMQ. Meh.
        <h2><a href="https://github.com/mcollina/mosca">Mosca</a></h2>
          A broker on Node.js. Didn't try.
        <h2>IBM</h2>
          IBMs efforts on both client and server side either mutated into
          cloud services, or merged into mosquitto.

          Seems like mosquitto is a clear winner - free, open-source, supported
          and doing what all the others are doing.

      <h1>Clients</h1>
      Clients come as libraries that are expected to be implemented to suit
      application specfic needs.

          There are many other client libraries, but they are usually either
          not fully developed (only QoS0 for example) or constrained in some other
          way (targeting exclusively embed, written in weird language ... ). I will
          give both Paho and libmosquitto a try.
