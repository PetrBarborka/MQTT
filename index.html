      MQTT is an open source network communication protocol that aims to be
      lightweight, low overhead and robust against weak and unstable connections.
      It follows the publish/subscribe design pattern with Clients connecting
      and subscribing to a Broker which directs the message flow. 
      It runs on TCP/IP networks using its own architecture of MQTT packets.
      <br><br>
      
      Here is what it looks like at different application levels:
      <br><br>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Hardware</th>
          <td>Computer</td>
          <td>Computer</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Software</th>
          <td>Client</td>
          <td>Broker</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Role</th>
          <td>Publisher/Subscriber</td>
          <td>Broker</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br style="clear:left"><br>
      As the protocol is open-source, there is many commercial and free 
      implementations of both clients and brokers with different design 
      philosophies. The implementation may for example provide advanced security
      features like TLS, gateways outside of TCP/IP networks or might be
      especially suited for embedded systems.

      <h1>The Basic principle</h1>
      <h2>The Network</h2>
      MQTT runs on a network consisting of one or more computers
      connected in a <span class="hi">TCP/IP</span> network
      <h2>The Software</h2>
      Two kinds of programs are running on the network: at least one
      <span class="hi">Broker</span> and at least two 
      <span class="hi">Clients</span> are needed for meaningful operation.
      <br> The Clients publish information to the Broker and the Broker sends
      them any information that concerns them. They communicate
      via TCP/IP packets.
      <h2>Operation</h2>
      The client <span class="hi">connects</span> to a Broker.
      <br>The client
      <span class="hi">subscribes</span> to one or more
      <span class="hi">Topics</span>. 
      <br>The client <span class="hi">publishes</span> a message to one of the 
      Themes. The Broker forwards that message to any Client connected to it and
      subscribed to that Theme.

    <div id="packets">
      <H1>Packets and processes</H1>
      This section describes the different processes that take place
      in the MQTT network along with packets that are used.
      <h2>Connection</h2>
      Once a Client establishes a TCP/IP connection to a Broker, it is required
      to send a CONNECT packet in a specified timeframe. The CONNECT packet must contain its clientID, information about whether it wishes to continue previously started session and may or may not contain authentification data (username, pwd), the last will, its QoS and ping interval to be used for the keep-alive procedure (in seconds). Once the CONNECT packet is received by the Broker, the Broker must always respond with a CONNACK packet starting whether previous session data is available and a return code for the connection stating whether the connection was accepted or why not (see standard).

      <h2>Subscription</h2>
      In order to receive messages from other clients, our client first needs to subscribe to a Topic. Topics are a great feature helping MQTT communication stay clear and well managed, see dedicated section. The subscription process is initiated with a SUBSCRIBE packet, that only contains a packetId for verification, a list of topics it wishes to subscribe to and a list of maximum Quality of service levels it wishes for that Topic. This value is a ceiling, so if our client specifies QoS 1 when subscribing to topic "a" and someone sends a message with QoS 2 on that topic, it gets handed to our client with QoS 1. The mandatory response is a SUBACK packet with return codes for each Topic. The standard permits, but doesn't require a procedure authorizing individual clients for individual topics. Some Broker providers, such as HiveMQ, provide such procedures using TLS certificates etc.

      <h2>Publishing</h2>
      Message transmission in a MQTT network is called publishing. Client C publishes a message on topic T to the Broker and every other Client connected to that Broker and subscribed to Topic T message gets the message. The PUBLISH packet contains an ID, Topic specification, maximum QoS level, a retain flag which states whether the message should be kept as a last valid value for that topic, the message itself or "payload" and a flag that specifies whether this is the original message or a resend attempt. <br>
      Publishing procedure varies greatly with QoS: 
      <ul>
        <li>QoS 0 means the message is sent once and the sender doesn't care about its fate. </li>
        <li>Qos 1 means the message is resent any number of
          times before the recipient confirms reception</li>
        <li>QoS 2 means both the sender and the receiver double
          check whether the message was received exactly once </li>
      </ul>
      This process works both ways: The Client publishes a message
      to the Broker and the Broker sends the same message through the same process to the concerned Clients.

      <h2>Keep-alive</h2>
      The keep-alive procedure serves to check whether the client is still available after a longer period of inactivity. The Client specifies the keep-alive interval in seconds in the CONNECT packet (with the ability to disable the procedure entirely) and then if the Broker has not received any packets from the Client for that specified ammount of time, it sends a PINGREQ packet expecting a PINGRESP response. The packets have no contents.
